# FeBTC_models

The force_field_validation folder contains the input files used for the validation of the UFF4MOF implementation in LAMMPS and its comparison with GULP and DFT. The DFT fragment was optimised at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G level of theory.

The final_models folder contains the five independent amorphous models for the three systems with different degree of disorder (SRO, MIX and MRO). The files are in xyz, PBC info are contained in the second line of the file (extended xyz format)
